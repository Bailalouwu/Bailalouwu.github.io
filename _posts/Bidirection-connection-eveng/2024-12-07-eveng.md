**Scenario**

I made this project to give final linux server for software implementation, The idea was emulate a controlled network using Cisco devices, all of this through [EVE-NG](https://www.eve-ng.net/).


The scope was easy, create a stable and scalable network, so I had to used 3 switches and 3 routers cisco, just to emulate and implement useful protocols, such a EtherChannel, VLANS, RSTP on Layer 2 OSI model, and  EIGRP and HSRP on Layer 3 OSI model.

**Instance creation**

EVE-NG Instance was installated on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances) following
[Community Cookbook](https://www.eve-ng.net/index.php/documentation/community-cookbook/) instructions

**Import of required devices**
I downloaded cisco devices from this [repo](https://github.com/hegdepavankumar/cisco-Images-for-GNS3-and-EVE-NG) and linux server from [EVE-NG repository](https://www.eve-ng.net/index.php/documentation/howtos/howto-create-own-linux-host-image/). Then I uploaded them using WinSCP getting this as a result on bin and qemu directories:

```bash
root@eve-ng:/opt/unetlab/addons/iol/bin# ls -la
total 264008
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root      4096 Mar 18 20:17 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root      4096 Mar 18 02:01 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root        37 Mar 18 19:58 iourc
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 110978612 Mar 15 03:46 L2-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M-15.2-20150703.bin
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 159350476 Mar 15 03:47 L3-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M-15.4-2T.bin

```
```bash
root@eve-ng:/opt/unetlab/addons/qemu# ls -la | grep linux
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root      4096 May  1  2022 linux-ubuntu-22.04-server
```

**Topology creation**
Like I said, the scope was to use useful protocols, so the topology must to allow use all of them.


**Intermediary devices configuration**
**LAYER 2**
VLAN MANAGENT:
LINK MANAGENT:
**LAYER 3**
VLAN GATEWAY:
EIGRP:
ACL AND NAT CONFIGURING:


**End devices configuration (server)**

**Port forwarding (Necessary for external communication)**
Instance side
