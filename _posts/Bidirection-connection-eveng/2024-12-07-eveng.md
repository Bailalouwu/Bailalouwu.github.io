**Scenario

I made this project to give final linux server for software implementation, The idea was emulate a controlled network using Cisco devices, all of this through a emulator, I used [EVE-NG](https://www.eve-ng.net/).

EVE-NG Instance was installated on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances)

The scope was easy, create a stable and scalable network, so I had to used 3 switches and 3 routers cisco, just to emulate and implement useful protocols, such a EtherChannel, VLANS, RSTP on Layer 2 OSI model, and  EIGRP HSRP on Layer 3 OSI model.

**Implementation

*Instance creation
*Import of required devices
*Topology creation
*Intermediary devices configuration
*End devices configuration (server)


*Port forwarding (Necessary for external communication)
